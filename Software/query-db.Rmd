```{r}

install.packages("RSQLite")
library("RSQLite")
sqlite <- dbDriver("SQLite")
dbname <- "DGN-WB_0.5.db" ## add full path if db file not in current directory

## connect to db

db = dbConnect(sqlite,dbname)

## list tables

dbListTables(db)
dbListFields(db, "weights")
dbListFields(db, "extra")

## convenience query function

query <- function(...) dbGetQuery(db, ...)

## example queries

query('select count(*) from weights')
query('select * from weights where gene = "GATA6" ')
query('select * from weights limit 10')

## how many genes are available for given tissue?
## dbname should be the name of the sqlite database for the tissue
query('select count(*) from extra')

## select genes with R2>0.01 (this is cor>0.1)
## ths won't work for the latest MASHR-based GTEx V8 models
## this only works for models where R2 is included. 
high.h2.genes <- query('select * from extra where R2 > 0.01')
